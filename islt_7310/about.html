        <h2>Man Chi Lee</h2>
        <p>I am a <b><i>science teacher</i></b> playing a leading role in organizing student activity at an international
            school. I like to record students’ activities by photo and video. Usually, I love to give them a
            tailor-made video clip as a memorable gift while they promote to the next class. I have not had
            any formal web lesson training before; however, I have tried to create a simple one by using wix.
            It is a powerful tool to build a website for those people who don't have a strong code skill just
            like me. I don’t have to understand how it works behind the scenes as long as I upload some
            pictures and videos into the template that I choose.</P>
        <p>
            I believe I will learn fundamental skills to build a website, I mean the real personal website. I
            would like to record my students' school life and have them manage it with me together.
            Hopefully, this website will become their lifelong thing to do with their classmates. I can tell this
            will be one of the most valuable things they keep in their life.
            <br/>
            I like reading fiction, the web one. I usually spend some time like 20-30 mins per day reading.
            When free time comes, I hang out with friends for some outdoor activities.</p>
        <h2>Education Overview</h2>
