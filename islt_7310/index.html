            <h2>Welcome to Man Chi Lee's Website</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Hong Kong, a famous food paradise. My family brought me to San Francisco in my early twenties. After working for several large nonprofit agencies in the city, I choose to become a teacher. Then a magical thing happened: I discovered my love for playing with students, I know, almost everyone loves playing. And over the course of a couple of life-changing years, I created my first website here. I am going to record my favorite memory with my students.</p>
