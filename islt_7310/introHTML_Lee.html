        I am a science teacher playing a leading role in organizing student activity at an international school. I like to record students’ activities by photo and video. Usually, I love to give them a tailor-made video clip as a memorable gift while they promote to next class. I have not had any formal web lesson training before; however, I have tried to create a simple one by using wix. It is powerful tool to build a website for those people who doesn’t have a strong code skill just like me. I don’t have to understand how it work behind the scene as long as I upload some pictures and videos into the template that I choose.
        I believe I will learn fundamental skills to build a website, I mean the real personal website. I would like to record my students school life and have them to manage it with me together. Hopefully, this website will become their life long thing to do with their classmate. I can tell this will be one of the most valuable things they keep in their life.I like reading fictions, the web one. I usually spend some time like 20-30 mins per day to read. When there a free time comes, I hand out with friends for some outdoor activities.
