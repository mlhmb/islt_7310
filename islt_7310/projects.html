                    <h2>Project# 1</h2>
                    <p>I was running a naturalization program for seniors in San Francisco, helping them become
                        citizens through legal means and to learn English so that they can live more dignified lives and
                        further exercise their right to express themselves. I also led a citizenship program for seniors at
                        Self Help for the Elderly, one of the largest non-profit organizations in the San Francisco
                        community. Assisting the seniors filling the application forms was my biggest challenging part of
                        my daily job, cause I had to spend hours to find out their personal information clearly. No
                        mistake should be made, right? When I trained my team to educate seniors, I emphasized some
                        of the broader goals we had. We were not just teaching seniors American history; we were
                        teaching them about American culture. And we were doing more than just helping seniors fill
                        out applications; they were becoming familiar with the immigration system in America.</p>

                    <h2>Project# 2</h2>
                    <p>From 2008 to 2013, I participated in meetings hosted by Homeland Security, and I appealed to
                        them to consider the hardships seniors in my community had to face. I brought senior citizens to
                        these workshops to share what they had gone through during the interview process. My goal
                        was to convey to Homeland Security officers that they needed to be patient and understanding
                        when conducting interviews.</p>

                    <h2>Project# 3</h2>
                    <p>In 2013, I was a pioneering member of San Francisco Pathways to Urbanization Initiative (SF
                        Pathways), which is another life experience that I am very proud of. In this program that is still
                        running today, we provided our services to all people free of charge. When the seniors I worked
                        with became citizens, I asked them to speak on a regular basis about their experiences with
                        other seniors in their community who were going through the program because I believe that
                        seniors should learn English not only to pass their interview, but also to be active citizens in their
                        community, capable of driving change.</p>
