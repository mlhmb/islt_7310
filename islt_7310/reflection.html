                    I am an ordinary elementary school teacher. I feel lucky that I have a lot of students who like me. Most of them were very excited and devoted during my classes. Today, I am going to share with you some of my school life with my students.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection-para">
                    I am a teacher who pays great attention to rituals. I think rituals are very important. Because the ritual can tell us what is going to happen and what attitude we need to be. Before introducing my teaching topic, I usually ask the students to do one thing together, which is a special class ceremony. The students clap their hands and make a neat sound by clapping the table to tell themselves that the time has come for them to take the lesson seriously. 
                </p>
                <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                <p class="reflection-para">
                    My teaching philosophy is to tell students to learn how to learn. There are a lot of things to find out in our life, and from the first day we set foot in the entrance hall of our school, it is only one-fifth of our life to graduate from college, but our lives are full of countless challenges to face, and countless difficulties need to be resolved. Besides, ever-changing technology almost makes us overwhelmed daily. I contact students every day and constantly guide them to understand one thing, that is, to learn how to learn. In my class, I never restrict the way of the students to learn, even as long as they are comfortable, they can lie down on the ground to learn because I believe that only learning in the most comfortable state can learn better.
                </p>
                <p class="reflection-para">
                    My understanding of learning and playing is that the two must be balanced. Let us imagine that if you can’t calm down when you are studying, and are full of ideas about how to play and what to play, can you learn? Certainly not! So I always tell my students that they should learn quickly so that they can play right away. When it's intact, come back and study seriously. I think this is a good rhythm. Moreover, I believe that learning is like eating. If you don’t have the appetite for learning as you don’t have the appetite for eating. That means you can’t learn anything. Therefore, as a teacher, I am more concerned about how to maintain their appetite for learning in classes, rather than just paying attention to how much they have learned during my classes. I want to see people who can learn, not people who can remember what they have learned. If my students can keep the desire to learn throughout their lives, that is my greatest achievement.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="reflection-para">
                    Just think about it, why are there different results from students for the same study time, the same teacher, and the same textbook? When I was working on my webpage, I kept thinking about this question. Later, I realized, so children’s learning is not only the work of teachers but also the work of parents. At home, parents need to accompany their children's growth. They need to be affirmed, approved and understood by their parents. As a teacher, I hope to share your children’s life in school here and hope that their joy can continue at home because of you.
